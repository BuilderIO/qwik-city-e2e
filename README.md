Commits to this repo will trigger each [workflow](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik-city-e2e/tree/main/.github/workflows), which will build and test on each server. The Node workflow tests the `dev`, `preview` and `express` Nodejs servers.

The [package.json](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik-city-e2e/blob/main/package.json) pnpm installs the build artifacts committed to [qwik-build](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik-build) and [qwik-city-build](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik-city-build). Update the commit hash in version for the `dependencies` of `@builder.io/qwik` and `@builder.io/qwik-city`.
